Feature: User can Create, edit and delete shifts

  As a User
  I want to create/edit/delete one or more shifts for each Event
  So that I can break and Event down into subtasks and organize volunteers by skill type.
  I want the text box for the event description to be larger so that I can have craft a better description for my event.

      | jane_doe@uprise.com | jane_doe | jane_doe_password |
    And I am on the homepage
    And I log in with username "john_doe" and password "john_doe_password"
    And the following events exist:
      | User    | Date       | Name          | Candidate |
      | 1       | 03/03/2018 | Go Batman     | Batman    |
    And the following shifts exist:
      | Event    | Role     | Has Limit | Limit | Start Time | End Time |
