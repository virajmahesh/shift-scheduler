Feature: Users Can See Which Shifts Have Been Filled
  
        As a user
        I want to be able to see which shifts have been filled
        so that I can select which shifts I want to volunteer for

Scenario: view total shifts available
        Given I am on the event page for event 1
        And event 1 has 4 shifts available
        Then I should see "4 shifts available"

Scenario: view event with filled shift
        Given I am on the event page for event 1
        And shift 1 belongs to event 1
        And shift 1 has limit 5
        And there are 5 volunteers for shift 1
        Then I should see "Shift 1 filled"

Scenario: view event with free shift
        Given I am on the event page for event 1
        And shift 1 belongs to event 1
        And shift 1 has limit 5
        And there are 3 volunteers for shift 1
        Then I should see "Shift 1 available"
